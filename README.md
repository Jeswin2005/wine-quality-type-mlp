# wine-quality-type-mlp
This project classifies red and white wines based on their physicochemical properties using two machine learning models: Random Forest (RF) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes attributes such as acidity, sugar levels, and density.
